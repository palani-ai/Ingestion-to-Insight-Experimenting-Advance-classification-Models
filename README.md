# Advance_classifications_with_titanic
Experimenting all advance classification models end to end with titanic dataset.

Data Ingestion to Insight in one place:
========================================
 Raw data ==> Database ==>. BigData ==> ML model ==> Application 
 
     (  --------------- Applied CRISP-DM process -------------)
                  
This End-to-End experiment includes all phases  "From data acquisition to Model deployment" using simple API and all possible ways to incorporate Bigdata pipeline.

Many of segments orchestrated from the concepts, best practices from Kaggle, Github and all other real-world scenarios to compose end-to-end for decision tree solutions in one place. 

Currently In-Progress...
